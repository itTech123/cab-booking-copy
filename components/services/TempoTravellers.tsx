        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-600">
          <p>
            Tempo travellers are an excellent choice for group travel, especially for large groups of more than eight people. 
            With spacious seating, ample leg space, sufficient aisle space, and a generous boot capacity, tempo travellers 
            and minibuses are designed to enhance your travel experience. For instance, you can book a 12-seater tempo traveller 
            with luxurious amenities for a small group or even consider hiring a 16-seater tempo to accommodate more members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it's an outstation trip with family, a road trip with friends, picnic with loved one to your favourite 
            destination in the city, spiritual pilgrimage, or corporate events, the convenience and comfort of travelling together 
            in a single vehicle is unparalleled. It not only ensures a stress-free journey but also creates a pleasant ambience 
            where everyone can relax and enjoy each other's company. This is the experience that Txigo Car Rentals aims to 
            provide with its tempo travellers and minibuses.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Issues Customers Face while booking a Tempo Traveller or Minibus</h2>
        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-600">
          <p>
            Although tempo traveller booking or hiring a minibus for rent is the best solution for a long trip with a large group, 
            there are a few challenges customers face while opting for a TT or minibus with local companies. Some common issues include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">Challenges in booking:</span> Not all companies can promise a seamless TT or mini-bus booking experience. 
              You may face challenges connecting with the customer care team, experience long wait times, poor communication, 
              and unavailability of online booking modes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">Lack of reliable rental tempo traveller:</span> With numerous logistics companies mushrooming in every corner of the city, 
              finding a trustworthy tempo traveller services provider is challenging. Moreover, finding a luxury tempo traveller 
              with great amenities is a struggle, as what you are promised while booking a TT may not always be delivered when your vehicle arrives.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">High tempo traveller cost:</span> Another issue that customers face is the high tempo traveller per km rate that local providers charge, 
              with no guarantee of well-maintained vehicles offered for travelling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">Lack of good amenities:</span> Besides good seating capacity and boot space, tempo travellers and minibuses are also known for other amenities, 
              such as air conditioning, charging points, first-aid kits, music systems, etc. While local TT providers claim to offer these facilities, 
              the vehicles may lack some or have non-functional equipment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">Substandard services:</span> Customers are often forced to deal with low-standard services when they book a tempo traveller. 
              From delayed pickup and drops to unprofessional drivers, choosing local players for TT and minibus services can lead to an unsatisfactory travel experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">Fewer options:</span> Not all TT providers can fulfil their customers' seating requirements. For instance, local players may lack a 20-seater minibus 
              or a higher tempo traveller seating capacity, thereby incapable of accommodating all group members.
